This project contains two Python files:

task1.py: A basic program which can help to identify whether a number is even or odd

in this task-1 i have taken an integer input from the user 
and using the if-else conditional statements i used the % modulus operator for calculating remainder and then using equality operator to check its remainder equal to 0 or not


task2.py: A simple program that prints the sum of the numbers within a range

in this task-2 i have used for loop as i knew how many iterations i had to go 
since the for loop range goes from u to u-1, i took the range from 1 to 51 
i also initialised 1 variable sum=0 so i can add the numbers each time loop iterates with the help of variable and range function
